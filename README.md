# E-commerce_FastApi-mongodb
This website uses Flask, FastApi, and MongoDB as an e-commerce platform. I used Python FastApi, Flask, and Mongodb to develop this website as practise.Where you'll find the contact and billing pages, which I saved as contact.html and cart.html, respectively.Before clicking the submit button on the billing page, enter the necessary information. Your data will then be saved in our mongodb database server. and FastApi will collect the informationInstall all packages into the venv directory of the Python virtual environment.
